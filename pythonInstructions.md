# Python Instructions

## Installation
The pipeline has been tested and run using several versions of python.  The current requirements file runs well with python 3.6.8 and so we reccomend you start with that version of python.

Visit our [python instructions](pythonInstructions.md) for installation instructions with python, if you need it.

```
# clone the ontology-data-pipeline
git clone https://github.com/biocodellc/ontology-data-pipeline.git

cd ontology-data-pipeline

# Install libraries (make sure you have python 3.6.8 installed)
pip install -r requirements

# verify that the tests run
python -m pytest
```
