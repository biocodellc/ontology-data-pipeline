Actually, I don't know why we want to make this fresh flower presence, as BBCH describes it as ""tip of inflorescence emerged from sheath, first spikelet just visible "" which would map better to ""reproductive bud presences"" . We need more info from Kjell on how this one is scored.  Kjell: This must have been a mistake from me! I think ths should be mapped as {reproductive bud presence} "
End of flowering: fruit set visible,{flower presence},,,0,,"John: Need to set lower_percent = 0; Kjell: This BBCH code (69) is mainly used for flowering and thus should not be used for mapping fruiting. I would not use it for mapping presence of flowering either, since it is used to report 'end' of flowering. For a phenologist, it is useful to estimate flowering period (BBCH69-BBCH60)."
Flowering finishing: majority of petals fallen or dry,{open flower presence},1,,,,Kjell: This is a two-thing observation. Both {open flower presence} and {senescence flower presence} are correct. I would still prefer to map it as {open flower presence} as BBCH69 is more commonly used for end of flowering.

Beginning of leaf-fall,{abscised leaf presence},1,,,,"Ramona: We think our proposal is to change this to just {abscised leaf presence} but we want to know more about how this category is determined in the field.   Our working supposition is that ""Beginning of leaf fall"" is when there are 0-5% of the leaves abscised, but we need more details from Kjell. In theory, 0-5% of leaves falling means there should also be 95-100% leaves on a plant, but based just on the label, we don't know what stage those leaves are in. They could be senescing, mature, or immature.KJELL: AGREE! I think it is much better to use {abscised leaf presence} only. Even if we often have to write instructions to the observers in such a way that we talk about both the leaves that are still on the tree and those that have fallen, I think it is much better if the PPO only talks about whtat we formally knows from the data. The PEP includes many different (national/regional) protocols, so if a specific protocol can be mapped to mutliple PPO classes, that is soemthing we should deal with in the phase of applying the PPO not in the phase where we are now."
