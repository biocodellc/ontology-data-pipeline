All leaf buds broken (lilac/honeysuckle),{unfolded true leaf presence},Does not work for absence because somes leaves are already unfolded before this phenophase occurs,95,100,0,,
Increasing leaf size,{expanding unfolded true leaf presence},Does not work for absence directly.  if asserted absent then make a lower percent of zero; if present then lower percent is 51% since it denotes a majority.
