# Building Executable

Some hints on building the executable are contained here:

Make sure you install python development libraries, in particular, those 
that match your installed version of python, e.g. if you have 3.7 python
then install the 3.7 specific dev environment: 

```
sudo apt-get install python3.7-dev
```

The following pyinstaller command works on an ubuntu box:

```
pyinstaller --hidden-import numpy.core._dtype_ctypes --distpath bin odpipeline.py -F
```
