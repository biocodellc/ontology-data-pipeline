        TestFixtures
        ============
        
        TestFixtures is a collection of helpers and mock objects that are
        useful when writing unit tests or doc tests.
        
        If you're wondering why "yet another mock object library", testing is
        often described as an art form and as such some styles of library will
        suit some people while others will suit other styles. This library
        contains common test fixtures the author found himself
        repeating from package to package and so decided to extract them into
        their own library and give them some tests of their own!
        
        The areas of testing this package can help with are listed below:
        
        **Comparing objects and sequences**
        
        Better feedback when the results aren't as you expected along with
        support for comparison of objects that don't normally support
        comparison. 
        
        **Mocking out objects and methods**
        
        Easy to use ways of stubbing out objects, classes or individual
        methods for both doc tests and unit tests. Special helpers are
        provided for testing with dates and times.
        
        **Testing logging**
        
        Helpers for capturing logging output in both doc tests and
        unit tests. 
        
        **Testing stream output**
        
        Helpers for capturing stream output, such as that from print
        statements, and making assertion about it. 
        
        **Testing with files and directories**
        
        Support for creating and checking files and directories in sandboxes
        for both doc tests and unit tests.
        
        **Testing exceptions**
        
        Easy to use ways of checking that a certain exception is raised, even
        down the to the parameters the exception is raised with.
